This is a solution implementation for the given Coding assignment - https://github.com/CompanyBook/Code-Challenge

#### How to use:

1. Clone the repo and run `maven clean install` from project directory. (All the tests should pass with build success)
2. Run the `DuplicateNamesResolver.main` method to generate the output on console which comes after processing the names.input file grouping all duplicate names together in a list of tuples.
